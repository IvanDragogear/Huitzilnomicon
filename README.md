Centralized management of social networks.

Why create another social media management app?
At first, this is planned as a personal project, but, beyond that, it will turn on adding additional functions that are not present in open source managers, such as a *publication journal*, *metrics* and *statistics*, * recommendations*, *spelling runner*, *post format compatibility check* (Ex: Number of characters for Twitter or Instagram image format), translation, preview and whatever is identified during development.
